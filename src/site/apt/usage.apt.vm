Usage

  To use this plugin, simply invoke it on your project, e.g.

---
mvn tidy:pom
---

  The <<<pom.xml>>> file will be rewritten into the canonical ordering, keeping as much as possible of the remainder
  of the <<<pom.xml>>> as is.

  Note: It is recommended that you use your IDE or other formatting tools to ensure that your <<<pom.xml>>> is indented
  correctly.

  Note: The following sections can have their child elements reordered without affecting the build:

  * <<</project/licenses>>>

  * <<</project/developers>>>

  * <<</project/contributors>>>

  * <<</project/mailingLists>>>

  * <<</project/properties>>>

  * <<</project/build/pluginManagement/plugins>>>

  * <<</project/profiles>>>

  []

  Note: The following sections potentially can affect the build process if the child elements are reordered:

  * <<</project/repositories>>>

  * <<</project/pluginRepositories>>>

  * <<</project/dependencyManagement/dependencies>>>

  * <<</project/dependencies>>>

  * <<</project/build/plugins>>>
